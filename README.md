Introduction to RSPt and bcc Fe

## Introduction 

#### Manual
the manual of RSPt is stored in the `documentation/manual/` folder in RSPt's repository.
To obtain the manual in pdf format one needs to go to that directory and type:
````
latex manual.tex
````
three times.

#### RSPt's basis set
![Basis set visualization](basis_set_visualization.png "Visualization of RSPt's basis set")

#### RSPt simulation files 
To execute the `rspt` binary you need the following files:
- `data` (compound specific info, what atoms, basic functions, etc...)
- `spts` (information of the k-mesh)
- `atomdens` (information of the overlapping atomic density, which is used as a starting guess)
- `symcof` (Information about symmetries and basis)

An existing calculating also contains:
- `pot` (the potential)
- `eparm` (linearlization energies)

When setting up a calculation from scratch, one starts with *one* file called `symt.inp`.
It contains the basic information such as lattice vectors, lattice parameter and atom positions.
From this file many of the files needed to run a simulation is generated. Below follows a step-by-step description of how to setup a simulation of bcc Fe.

## bcc Fe

#### 0. Download tutorial from github
Download the tutorial from github by typing:
```
git clone https://github.com/RSPt-tutorials/day1-basics.git
```
This will download the following tutorial content:
- This `README.md` file
- `symt.inp`  (RSPt input file for bcc Fe)
- folder `input` (compare your input setup with this help folder) 
- folder `lsda` (compare your converged DFT calulations with this help folder)
- folder `lsda-dos` (compare your DOS with the DOS in this help folder) 
- `basis_set_visualization.png` (figure schematically visualizing the basis functions in RSPt)

#### 1. Preparations
Before using RSPt, make sure the same modules are loaded as when compiling RSPt.
E.g. on Rackham, type:
```
module load intel/18.1 intelmpi/18.1
```
A convinient way is to load the module automatically at login by putting the command in the `~/.bashrc` file.

#### 2. Create simulation folder
To create a simulation from cratch one starts by creating and moving into a simulation folder, e.g.: 
```
mkdir Fe
cd Fe
``` 

#### 3. Create `symt.inp`
Create folder `sym` and move inside that folder: 
```
mkdir sym
cd sym
```
The `symt.inp` should contain basic information about the system. 
For a complete overview of possible input parameters in `symt.inp`, check out [documentation/manual](documentation/manual/).
In our case a functioning [`symt.inp`](symt.inp) already exists which we can copy to our `sym` folder.
The `symt.inp` works with free format, meaning keywords are used to categorize the information. 
The keywords in the provided `symt.inp`:
- `lengthscale` (lattice parameters)
- `latticevectors` (the latticevectors in column format)
- `spinpol` (to tell RSPt that the simulation should be spin polarized)
- `mtradii` (parameter to optimize Muffin-tin radius)
- `atoms` (first number of atoms in the unitcell followed by (position, atomic number, coordinate keyword, identity-tag) of each atom. The coordinate keyword tells if the atomic position is expressed in lattice-vectors (using `l`) or in cartesian coordinates (using `c`). The identity-tag can be used to distinguish between otherwise equivalent atoms. This tag can also be used to generate spin-polarized atomic densities, by either using tag `up` or tag `dn`.)
- `lmax` (how many spherical harmonics shall be used to express density and potential)

Once the `symt.inp` has the desired setup, type:
```
symt -all
```
Now many the folders `atom`, `bin`, `bz`, `dta` and some files should exist.

#### 4. Generate atomic density
Starting from the main diretory:
```
cd atom
make
```
This will generate an atomic density which will be used as a starting point for the DFT calculations.

#### 5. Generate k-mesh
Starting from the main diretory:
```
cd bz
cub
```
The user should now tell which symmetry-file to use when generating the k-mesh.
Almost always, use the default option (read ../symcof) by pressing the `enter` key.

Then specify desired k-mesh, e.g. `12 12 12`.

Input numerators for k-mesh shift vector, e.g. `0 0 0`.

Input deminonators for k-mesh shift vector, e.g. `1 1 1`.

Confirm the k-mesh by pressing the `enter` key.

Create tetrahedrons by pressing the `enter` key.

Finally type the `enter` key to quit the k-mesh generator. 

One has to actually select which k-mesh rspt should use, in case many were created in the `bz` directory.
To select the k-mesh generated by the commands above, type:
```
cd ..
link_spts 12_no
```
This generates symbolic links `spts`, `tetra` and `kmap` which point to the generated k-mesh in the `bz` directory.

#### 6. `dta` folder settings
The `dta` folder contains many settings for the basis set.
One has to copy two files:
```bash
cp dta/length_scale .
cp dta/strain_matrix .
```
There are two philosophies of how to edit the settings stored in the `dta` folder.
Either one makes the wanted changes in the files in the `dta` folder or one leaves the `dta` folder unchanged and make the wanted changes at a later stage. In this tutorial we will do the latter. 

#### 7. Generate the `data` file
Generate the final input file, called `data`, by typing:
```
make data
```
Since we did no changes in the `dta` folder, we can instead make the wanted changes in the `data` file. 
(Note that it is the information in the `data` file which is being read by the `rspt` binary and not those in the `dta` folder.)

In this tutorial we want to use the LDA functional instead of the default PBE functional. We make this change by editing the `data` file. Instead of:
```
  lmax ntype  zval     . icorr     .  pmix   win   wmt f-rel sp-po     .
     8     1  16.0     8    34    1.  .500     t     t     f     t     1  
```
Change the icorr value to 02, hence update to:
```
  lmax ntype  zval     . icorr     .  pmix   win   wmt f-rel sp-po     .
     8     1  16.0     8    02    1.  .500     t     t     f     t     1  
```

The DFT mixing parameter `pmix` in the `data` file is .5 by default, which is usually too big.
Let's change it to be .05 instead:
```
  lmax ntype  zval     . icorr     .  pmix   win   wmt f-rel sp-po     .
     8     1  16.0     8    02    1.  .050     t     t     f     t     1  
```

There are differents methods for doing the integration in the reciprocal space. 
The default method uses tetrahedrons but we would like to change to a method which uses Fermi smearing.
We achieve this by replacing the `1` on row 10 by a `0`. 
We also change the temperature by editing the first value on row 13 to 0.0005.
The rows 9-13 in the `data` file, about the k-integration, should now look like:
```
(i6)
     0
 (/ 2f12.0, i6)
       W(Ry)        dE/W     .
      0.0005          4.     0       
```

We also want to modify the tail-energies so that all tail-energies are negative. (This gives more robust calculations it decreaces the condition number of the overlap matrix.) Change the first tail-energy from 0.3 to -0.1 on row 21 such that rows 20-23 look:
```
 (f12.0, f5.0, i1, i3, 3i2, l3, f6.0, i3, 6f12.0)
        -0.1   .01  0 1 0 1  f    .0  0          .0       
        -2.3   .01  0 1 0 1  f    .0  0          .0
        -1.5   .01  0 1 0 1  f    .0  0          .0
```

Finally the want to have a look at the linearization energies.
The basis functions for Fe is described in the end of the data file:
```
    12 Bases
     0     1     1
     0     1     2
     0     1     3
     1     1     1
     1     1     2
     1     1     3
     2     1     1
     2     1     2
     0     2     1
     0     2     2
     1     2     1
     1     2     2
     4     4     3     4     5     6     7     8     9
     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0
     4     4     3     4     5     6     7     8     9
     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0
     3     3     3     4     5     6     7     8     9
     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0
     3     3     3     4     5     6     7     8     9
     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0
```
The first row (`12 Bases`) says that there are 12 l-projected basis functions.
Then follows one row per basis function, where each row contains (l-quantum number, energy-set, tail-index).
Thus, in the fist energy-set we have s, p and d basis funtions and in the second energy-set we only have s and p basis functions.

The last rows tells which principle quantum numbers and linearization flags the basis functions have.
Since we do spin-polarized calculations there are four rows per energy-set (two rows for spin down and two for spin up).
Let's focus on the first row:  
```
     4     4     3     4     5     6     7     8     9     
```
It says that the principle quantum numbers of the first energy-set, which we from above know has s, p and d functions, are: 4, 4, 3.
Thus the basis functions of the first energy-set are: 4s, 4p and 3d.

The second energy-set has basis functions: 3s and 3p. 
Since the basis functions of the second energy set are lower in energy than the first energy-set it is common to change the linearlization flags of those basis functions to `-1`. 
We also change the linearlization flags in the first energy-set so that the 4s and 4p functions become orthogonal to 3s and 3p, respectively, by using `20` and `21`. Finally we also change the linearization flag for the 3d functions to `-1`.
Now, the information about the principle quantum numbers and the linearlization flags of the Fe basis functions should look like:
```
     4     4     3     4     5     6     7     8     9
    20    21    -1     0     0     0     0     0     0
     4     4     3     4     5     6     7     8     9
    20    21    -1     0     0     0     0     0     0
     3     3     3     4     5     6     7     8     9
    -1    -1     0     0     0     0     0     0     0
     3     3     3     4     5     6     7     8     9
    -1    -1     0     0     0     0     0     0     0
```

#### 8. Execute the `rspt` binary 
Now everything is ready and we want to execute the `rspt` binary.
Either use an interactive session or submit a job.

To request an interactive session on the Rackham computer with 10 processors, type:
```bash
interactive -n 10 -t 00:15:00  --qos=short  -A g2018015
```
Once granted access, run RSPt by executing the `rspt` binary:
```bash
srun -n 10 rspt 
```
This will run one DFT iteration and use 10 MPI ranks.
To perform several iterations either use a bash-loop:
```bash
for ((i=1;i<=20;i++));do
  srun -n 10 rspt
done
```
or use the `runs` binary:
```bash
runs 'srun -n 10 rspt' 1e-8 20
```
The latter will run 20 DFT iterators or stop if the converge parameter `fsq` becomes smaller than 1e-8.

A submit jobscript should look something like:
```bash
#!/bin/bash -l
#SBATCH -A g2018015
#SBATCH -p core --qos=short
##SBATCH -p devel
#SBATCH -n 10
#SBATCH -t 00:15:00

echo "hello"
for ((i=1;i<=20;i++));do
  srun -n 10 rspt
done
echo "bye"
```

#### 9. Analyze RSPt output
There are a few things to check to make sure the simulation is reliable:

- The convergence parameter `fsq` is stored in the `out` file and as the first number in the `convergence` file. 
  Its value should reach an acceptably small number before the simulation can be considered converged.
- There should not be any star in the second column below the `Energy parameters` keyword.
- The second number below the `Fourier transform parameters` keyword should be equal to `6`.
- The `leakage` value should be less than 0.1.
- The muffin-tin value corresponding to the keyword `2S` should be around 0.95.
- The total energy is converged. To see how total energy and fsq have changed during the iterations type: 
  ```grep 'e  ' hist```

#### 10. Generate DOS 

To generate density of states (DOS) and projected DOS (PDOS) for e.g. the 3d orbitals, one can provide a `green.inp` file.
In our case its content can be:
```bash
matsubara
1024  60  60  10   ! nmats head body tail

convergency
1d-6 1d-5  0  0    ! ndelta sigma_acc maxiter maxsolveriter

energymesh
1001 -1.0 1.0 0.01

projection
2                  ! 1: MT, 2: ORT

spectrum
Dos Pdos

cluster
1 0              ! ntot udef [nsites]
1 2 1 1 0        ! t l e site basis[cubic harm] U J or F0 F2 F4 (F6)
```
Now just execute `rspt` once to obtain DOS and PDOS, stored in the following files:
- `dos.dat` 
- `pdos-0102010100-obs.dat` 
To plot the Fe 3d PDOS in using gnuplot, type:
```bash 
gnuplot
```
and then the gnuplot command:
```gnuplot
p "pdos-0102010100-obs.dat" w l
```
To plot using Python, type:
```bash
ipython
```
and then the Python commands:
```python
import matplotlib.pylab as plt 
import numpy as np
x = np.loadtxt("pdos-0102010100-obs.dat")
plt.plot(x[:,0],x[:,1])
plt.show()
```
